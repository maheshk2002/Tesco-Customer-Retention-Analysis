# Retail Customer Retention Analytics - TESCO

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn and retention strategies for Tesco. Using Power BI, I analyzed a cohort of 300 customers to identify why customers are leaving and provided actionable recommendations to improve loyalty.

## Key Insights
* **Churn Rate:** 51.67% (Critical Issue)
* **Loyalty Paradox:** The "Platinum" tier has the highest churn rate (55.95%), indicating a broken value proposition.
* **High-Value Risk:** High-value customers in regions like Liverpool are at the highest risk of churning.

## Recommendations
1.  **Fix the Loyalty Program:** Shift Platinum perks from points to tangible benefits.
2.  **Targeted Campaigns:** Launch "Rescue Campaigns" in high-churn regions like Liverpool and London.

## Files Included
* **Power BI-Project.docx:** Full project report and methodology.
