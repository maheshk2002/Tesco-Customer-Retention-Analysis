# 📊 TESCO Customer Retention Analytics

## Project Overview
This project analyses customer churn and retention strategies for Tesco. Using Power BI, I analysed a cohort of 300 customers to identify why customers are leaving and provided actionable recommendations to improve loyalty.

## 🔑 Key Findings and Insights
* **Churn Rate:** 51.67% (Critical Issue)
* **Loyalty Paradox:** The "Platinum" tier has the highest churn rate (55.95%), indicating a broken value proposition.
* **High-Value Risk:** High-value customers in regions like Liverpool are at the highest risk of churning.

## ✅ Top 3 Recommendations

Based on the insights, here are the three most urgent, high-impact recommendations :

1. **Fix the Inverted Loyalty Program:** The Platinum tier is failing. We recommend shifting its perks away from points (which they don't use) toward tangible, immediate benefits like free delivery or exclusive access.
2. **Launch Hyper-Targeted "Rescue Campaigns":** Immediately target high-risk segments identified in the drill-down analysis, such as **Females with Medium Income shopping at Superstores in Manchester (100% churn).
3. **Prioritize High-Risk, High-Value Locations:** Focus intervention on high-churn regions that contain high-CLV segments, such as **London** (highest overall churn) and **Liverpool** (home to the 8.6K CLV Silver segment)[cite: 251, 270, 271].
